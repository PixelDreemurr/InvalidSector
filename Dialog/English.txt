# NOTES:
# The # Symbol at the start of a line counts as a Comment. To include in dialog, use a \#
# The . Symbol will cause a pause unless escaped with \. (ex: Mr. Oshiro has a pause, Mr\. Oshiro does not)
# Newlines automatically create a Page Break, unless there is an {n} command on the previous line
# Commands: Anything inside of curly braces {...} is a command and should not be translated.

# Inline Text Commands:
# {~}wavy text{/~}
# {!}impact text{/!}
# {>> x}changes speed at which characters are displayed{>>}
# {# 000000}this text is black{#} (uses HEX color values)
# {+MENU_BEGIN} inserts the dialog from the MENU_BEGIN value (in English, "CLIMB")
# {n} creates a newline, without a page break
# {0.5} creates a 0.5 second pause
# {big}this text is large{/big}

# Gameplay Control Commands (should never change)
# {trigger x} this triggers an in-game event
# {anchor} controls the visual position of the textbox in-game

Based on this note it seems I have arrived in the right place!

[MADELINE right distracted]
I just need to follow the trail until I get to the locked door...

InvalidSectorK1S3=
[MADELINE right sad]
Then I just need to scavenge around a little for the {#f6ff00}key{#}.

InvalidSectorK1S4=
[MADELINE right determined]
Time to see what else this mountain is hiding.

It seems that the note just ends here... {0.5}{0.5} That can't be good.

The day forgotten...
Never {~}recalled{/~}
[MADELINE left sad]
Are you {0.5}{0.5}ok?
[MADELINE_MIRROR right deadpan]
They forgot about... {0.5}{~}what happened{/~}
The leftovers still remain on the table
[MADELINE left upset]
Can you please explain what you are talking about?
[MADELINE_MIRROR right deadpan]
And if you ever continue passed this point...
I can't guarantee what will come of you
And you will see things and do things you weren't meant to
[MADELINE left upset]
Who are you anyway?
[MADELINE_MIRROR right deadpan]
Last time I went on my adventure, I went down this trail...
That was the last time I went anywhere.
I remain stuck {~}inbetween{/~}
[MADELINE left upset]
Alright. Say nothing if you can hear me.
[MADELINE_MIRROR right deadpan]
...
[MADELINE left normal]
Ok. So now I ask again. Who are you anyway?
[MADELINE_MIRROR right deadpan]
This... gap
It isn't too wide though
It's just big enough to cause a crack in the layers
I got stuck {1.5}{~}inbetween{/~}
